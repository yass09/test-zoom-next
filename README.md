# Image Viewing and Zooming App

### Made with NextJs 13

Welcome to this image viewing and zooming app made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). This a test of the framework and it was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

> NB: The app was created with the Pages folder routing, since the App router is still very new. Another version with the App router will be done shortly.

This app is composed of a homepage from where you can navigate to a image list page.

From there you will be able to select an image which will open in its own page with a magnifier tool which will enable you to zoom inside of it.

To get started run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This app has also been deployed [here](https://test-zoom-next.vercel.app) via Vercel.
